# BREAST-CANCERPREDICTION
Cancer prediction on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset using supervised learning - Logistic Regression. The model have achieved 94% of accuracy

This project implements Logistic Regression to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for medical diagnosis tasks.
